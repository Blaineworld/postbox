		<small>Markdown is a markup language initially created by John Gruber and used on many sites. Of course, you don't really care and just want to see the tutorial, so here it is...</small>
		<small>Please note that although Markdown normally supports HTML tags, Postbox Markdown does not allow you to use HTML tags for security reasons. Someone could add a &lt;script&gt; tag!</small>
		<h3 id="escape-sequences">Escape Sequences</h3>
		<p>In programming, an escape sequence is a sequence of characters that changes the meaning of a character to something else. A typical example of this is a string in "quotation marks" where you want to have a quotation mark in the string, so you use <code>\"</code> to tell the computer that the quotation mark is just a quotation mark and isn't the end of the string. The same thing applies in Markdown, too. You can use a <code title="backslash">\</code> to say that a character is just a character and doesn't mean anything else. For example, you might need a # in a heading, so instead of <code># # My Heading</code>, which results in a level two heading saying <i>My Heading</i>, you use <code># \# My Heading</code> so that the # is treated as just part of the text. These can be used on pretty much anything that uses a character to represent a style.</p>

		<h3 id="typographical-structures">Typographical Structures</h3>
		<h4 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h4>
		<p>A paragraph, in case you somehow don't know, is a block of text that separates a piece of writing into smaller parts. In Markdown, you can create paragraphs by adding one or more lines of whitespace below a piece of text.</p>

		<h4 id="headings">Headings</h4>
		<p>There are two ways to make headings in Markdown. The first one is with 1-6 <code>#</code>s depending on the level of your heading like <code># This is a top heading.</code>. The "level" of a heading is basically just how small it is. The other is by underlining your heading with <code>=</code> or <code>-</code>, where <code>=</code> is the larger one.</p>

			<summary>Quick Tip</summary>
			<small>Headings are also given IDs based on their content so that you can refer to them using links. For example, the heading <code>### This is a heading.</code> could be linked to using the link <code>[Link to the heading.](#thisisaheading)</code>.</small>
		</details>
		<h4 id="blockquotes">Block Quotes</h4>
		<p>A block quote is a quote set aside from the main article in its own rectangle, and you can create them by adding a <code>&gt;</code> before each line of the quote. Block quotes can also have other block quotes inside of them, as well as lists and other elements.</p>

			</table>
		</details>
		<h4 id="blockquotes">Code Blocks</h4>
		<p>A code block is kind of like a block quote except that instead of a quote it's computer code and it cannot contain other elements or styles. You can write a piece of code inside of a line by <code>`doing this`</code>, or you can do what is shown in the visual example.</p>

		<h4 id="lists">Lists</h4>
		<p>A list is a list of things. There are multiple types of lists you can use in Markdown, which you can see below.</p>
		<h5 id="unordered-lists">Unordered Lists</h5>
		<p>An unordered list is a list that isn't numbered, which is why it's unordered. Each item on an unordered list is preceded by either <code>* </code>, <code>+ </code>, or <code>- </code>.</p>

		<h5 id="ordered-lists">Ordered Lists</h5>
		<p>An ordered list is a list that is numbered, which is why it's ordered. Each item on an ordered list is preceded by <code><i>n</i>. </code>, where <i>n</i> is any number. You don't necessarily need to number the items correctly, as it will have no effect on the output.</p>

		<h4 id="bold-and-italics">Bold and Italics</h3>
		<p>Did you know italics are called that because they were invented in Italy? Sorry. Anyway, <b>bold</b> and <i>italics</i> are pretty simple to do in Markdown. To create <i>italic</i> text, you may surround your text with either <code>*asterisks*</code> or <code>_underscores_</code>. For <b>bold</b> text, simply do the same thing, but double the <code>**asterisks**</code> or <code>__underscores__</code>.</p>

		<h4 id="strikethrough">Strikethrough</h4>
		<p>A strikethrough is when you don't like a piece of text so then you put a line through it and write something else in its place, but sometimes you want to add one intentionally. That's why Markdown has strikethrough, which you can apply using ~~double tildes~~ like so: <code>~~This text is scratched out.~~</code></p>

		<h2 id="what-is-postbox">What is Postbox?</h2>
		<p>Postbox is like social media. Well, sort of. It's not like any social media you've probably used. It only exists locally on each instance of a browser in the form of local storage, meaning that if you post something on one computer it will stay on that computer unless you delete all the data. It will never go anywhere else unless you move it. Postbox is totally anonymous, and posts are removed after a certain amount of time, which is determined by its "score." Also, help me. My inner voice has randomly turned into the guy that narrates Kurzgesagt videos.</p>
		<h3 id="what-is-a-score">What is a "score?"</h3>
		<p>A post's "score" attempts to measure how "good" a post is. It starts at one, increasing by one when it is upvoted and decreasing by one when it is downvoted.</p>
		<h3 id="how-do-i-vote">How do I vote?</h3>
		<p>If you look at a Postbox post, you will see in the top right corner a gray turd-lookin' thing with a number on it and two arrows that kind of look like the buttons on the outside of an elevator. If the arrows are <color style="color:lime">green</color> and <color style="color:red">red</color>, you may vote. However, if they are black you cannot, as votes can only be cast every five minutes. The green arrow on the left if the upvote button, and the other is the downvote button. Clicking on one of them when the vote timeout is not in effect will cast the corresponding vote for that post. The reason you have to wait is to prevent people just spamming the vote buttons to get their post to the top.</p>

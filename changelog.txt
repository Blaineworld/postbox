--    Alpha 0.2    --

  + Added this changelog! :)

  + Hovering the mouse over a post's title now shows its ID.

  + Introduced an upvote / downvote system, currently known as "points."
    Posts may be upvoted or downvoted every five minutes. Once a post is
    voted, five minutes must pass before another post can be voted. The
    cooldown might be changed in the future to prevent addictions to
    self-upvoting, but it's basically like Reddit but with cooldowns.
    Making it actually took much longer than I thought it would.

  + Introduced new styles for <code> elements, which are now also copied
    automatically just by triple-clicking them, because we all copy half
    our code from GitHub. The other 90% is from StackOverflow. When you
    hover over it, it fades in to a very l33t color scheme.

  + List items now glow white when hovered over and are now copied with
    a triple-click.

  + There's a manual now! Access it with the button in the top right.
    It's not even close to being ready though.

  + Tried to add the auto-deletion thing the manual mentions but it was
    saying some date in 1970 for absolutely no reason and it makes me so
    freaking mad!!!!!!!!!! That's why I disabled it and you won't see it
    in this release. Hopefully I can fix whatever this heckin' bug is.

  * Improved the block quote styles.

  * Posts are now sorted by their newness AND their score (since scores just got added).

  * Tweaked what cursors are used where.

--   Alpha 0.2.1   --

  + Added this to the change log.

  + Established that the names of update commits will use lowercase for the word update.

  + Fixed the post dates and by extension the auto-removal system! Yay!
    Turns out I was multiplying the character codes by multiples of 256
    instead of 65536, because UTF-16, you know... is literally UTF-*16*.

  + Wrote a bit more of the manual.

--    Alpha 0.3    --

  + Downvotes actually exist now!

  + The manual now includes an incomplete section all about Markdown.

  + The translation engine now supports multiple variables.

  * It is now COMPLETELY impossible for posts to overwrite each other. In addition to
    this, post IDs now consist of 5 characters instead of 4.

  i Removed all the bad code. What did it cost? All of the code. Basically, I just
    rewrote postbox.js because it was a buggy mess.

  ~ Most numbers are now stored as base-36 because I'm terrible.

  ~ The translation engine is now a separate script that the Postbox engine depends on.

--   Alpha 0.3.1   --

  @ Did you know there are configuration settings inside postbox.js?

  @ Sorry if this version's patch notes have the sections in the wrong order,
    I'm supposed to be sleeping.

  - Removed Herobrine.

  - Removed postbox-old.js. That was supposed to get deleted before release.

  - Removed showdown.min.js.map.webloc. Not sure what that was.

  - Removed the old duplicate changelog.txt from Postbox Web Interface.
    Not sure how it got there.

  + Postbox's Showdown configuration now has emojis enabled.

  + There are now announcements in the changelog.

  + The manual now links to Showdown's syntax guide.

  * "Internal change" is now called "logical change."

  ~ If an error occurs when loading a post, the post is just skipped instead
    of failing to display the other posts. This behavior also applies to all
    Postbox methods that use the postbox.read method for multiple posts, which
    is currently just postbox.removeExpiredPosts.

  i The localStorage is now reversed-sandboxed by default.

  ? Going to reintroduce admin-only methods.

--   Alpha 0.3.2   --

  ~ Apparently the error message when your post content was outside the valid
    character range used the title character range.

--    Alpha 0.4    --

  @ If you enable admin mode and aren't authorized you're a furry and you indent
    your code with spaces instead of tabs.

  + Began adding admin functionality. Currently the only admin methods available
    are postbox.admin.hardReset() and postbox.admin.resetCooldowns(). If admin
    mode is disabled and you try to use these, an error will be thrown.

--    Alpha 0.5    --

  @ I am now going to strictly follow semantic versioning.

  + Postbox now has an event system, but it doesn't really do much yet.

  + The manual can now have tables in it.

  + The manual now contains a proper Markdown guide. It's very incomplete, but
    will be expanded upon in Alpha 0.5.1.

  + The manual now has its own selection style!

  * The default title character limit is now 60 characters instead of 50.

  i Fixed the <code> style in the manual.

  i Fixed the order of the bullet points in Alpha 0.3.1's changelog.

  ~ Removed the trailing blank line from some of the files.

  ? Planning to add a technical section to the manual.

  ? Planning to add events (programming events, not social events) to Postbox.

  ? Probably going to change the post title and content to use ASCII, since you
    can use GitHub emojis on Postbox now.

  ! I am aware that Markdown allows you to use any URL for a link including
    JavaScript execution and that this is a security issue.

--    Alpha 0.6    --

  - HTML tags can no longer be used in posts, although you can still use
    character entities. I do plan to switch to ASCII after all.

  + Added more to the Markdown guide.

  + You can now define image dimensions.

  + You can now use tables in your posts.

  * Changed the manual background to be less GPU intensive.

--   Alpha 0.6.1   --

  + There is now a section in the markdown guide about emojis. It currently
    only includes emojis beginning the letter A and the B emoji, but will be
    expanded over time as I release more versions. At least 15 more emojis in
    the table per release until they're all included.

  ? Going to modify showdown.js so that it will display images from the /emoji
    folder instead of actual emojis, then it will look nice on all fonts. :smile:

--    Alpha 0.7    --

  + I added Minecraft emojis because Fortnite bad.

  * Using an emoji will now show an image from the /emoji directory, like I said
    in Alpha 0.6.1. This is a big update, as it means I or anyone will be able to
    add and remove emojis at will, but it's also a big responsibility because I
    have to manually add all the emojis. (Oh no!) Emojis can be placed anywhere
    within the emoji directory or any subdirectory and must be saved with the
    file extension .png, not necessarily PNG format but who cares?

--    Alpha 0.8    --

  @ How do I make it stop copying my JS files into the root directory?

  + Add a few face emojis. Not all of them, just a few.

  + Added the Alpha 0.7 changelog because apparently it didn't upload last time.

  * Emojis are now GIFs. Not only does this allow animated emojis, but it also
    reduces their file size and allows for easier pixel art coloring. I haven't
	converted all the existing emojis yet, but those will be available soon.

  i Emoji hovernotes now include the :colons:.

  i Emojis are no longer draggable.

  i Emojis are now 16x16 pixels so the Minecraft ones look nice.

  i Emojis no longer have alt text, and will now only display the broken image icon.

  i The default emojis no longer ever have under_scores in their names, as
    _underscores_ are used in Markdown to italicize text.

  ! Don't ask why the emojis aren't transparent yet. It's MS Paint.

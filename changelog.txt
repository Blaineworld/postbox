  + Added this changelog! :)

  + Hovering the mouse over a post's title now shows its ID.

  + Introduced an upvote / downvote system, currently known as "points."
    Posts may be upvoted or downvoted every five minutes. Once a post is
    voted, five minutes must pass before another post can be voted. The
    cooldown might be changed in the future to prevent addictions to
    self-upvoting, but it's basically like Reddit but with cooldowns.
    Making it actually took much longer than I thought it would.

  + Introduced new styles for <code> elements, which are now also copied
    automatically just by triple-clicking them, because we all copy half
    our code from GitHub. The other 90% is from StackOverflow. When you
    hover over it, it fades in to a very l33t color scheme.

  + List items now glow white when hovered over and are now copied with
    a triple-click.

  + There's a manual now! Access it with the button in the top right.
    It's not even close to being ready though.

  + Tried to add the auto-deletion thing the manual mentions but it was
    saying some date in 1970 for absolutely no reason and it makes me so
    freaking mad!!!!!!!!!! That's why I disabled it and you won't see it
    in this release. Hopefully I can fix whatever this heckin' bug is.

  * Improved the block quote styles.

  * Posts are now sorted by their newness AND their score (since scores just got added).

  * Tweaked what cursors are used where.

  + Added this to the change log.

  + Established that the names of update commits will use lowercase for the word update.

  + Fixed the post dates and by extension the auto-removal system! Yay!
    Turns out I was multiplying the character codes by multiples of 256
    instead of 65536, because UTF-16, you know... is literally UTF-*16*.

  + Wrote a bit more of the manual.

  + (Attempted) to add the change log and manual to README.md inside <iframe>s.

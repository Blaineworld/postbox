  + The Markdown guide now includes a section on HTML character entities.

  * Posts are now sorted using a "smarter" algorithm.

  * Version names are now entirely lowercase.

  i Posts are now actually sorted.

  i The version number is now unselectable and has no animation.

  i The vote buttons no longer use the interactive cursor when unavailable.

--   Alpha 1.1.2   --

  + The manual now opens in a window kind of thing.

  i Fixed the names of the Minecraft fish emoji in Alpha 1.1's changelog.

  ~ The help button is now on top of everything so you can close the manual.

--    Alpha 1.1    --

  @ Humidity is just a measure of how juicy the air is.

  @ Note that the :minecraft/fish: emoji is a tropical fish (clownfish). For cod,
    use :minecraft/cod:, and for salmon, use :minecraft/salmon:.

  @ The animation for falling off the edge was originally much more realistic,
    but the performance wasn't that great so I changed it to a simple wipe.

  + Added emoji from Hugging Face to Drooling Face. (That's 18 emoji.)

  + Added the following Minecraft emoji: Horse Armor, Melon Slice, and Nether Wart

  + Added three new methods: Postbox.version(), .lastPosted() and .lastVoted().

  + Buttons have proper depth to them now.

  + The part in the manual about headings now includes duplicate headings' IDs.

  + The version number is now visible from the web interface and clicking on it
    opens this changelog.

  + The web interface has a custom scrollbar to better fit the design of the page in
    Webkit browsers. (Seriously, why is there no standard way to style scrollbars?)

  ~ Added more post IDs.

  ~ Renamed postbox to Postbox.

  ~ Removed the declaration methodPostOld because I forgot to in alpha 1.0.

  ? Definitely need to make the changelog and manual open in frames.

  ? I think I might add fonts and/or text colors, what do you think?

--    Alpha 1.0    --

  @ Added no new emoji. Instead, I editing some existing ones, which can be seen below.
    In case you're wondering, I'm trying to add all the Unicode emoji in the order they
    are listed on [ https://emojipedia.org/people/ ] and next up is Hugging Face.

  @ I did some testing in Firefox and everything works there too! (It seems that it's
    actually faster that Chrome on my Raspberry Pi, which contradicts my experience
    using it on my laptop where it was slower than Chrome.)

  @ I've decided that URLs in the changelog will be [ in spaced square brackets ].

  + Added a new post format!

  + Added a specification for the new post format.

  + Added future-proofing for the post format in the form of a 16-bit version number.

  + Added :minecraft/brewing-stand: and :minecraft/broken-elytra: because I'm a liar.

  + Automatic self-upvoting can now be changed and triggers the vote cooldown.

  + A new administrator method, postbox.admin.write(id, data), has been added and is used
    in all methods that change posts, such as postbox.post(content, title) and
    postbox.upvote(id) in order to more easily save the new format.

  + A new method, postbox.exists(id), has been added.

  + Buttons now have a short press/unpress animation.

  + Thanks to the new format not using them, you can use nulls in your post title now!

  + The help button is now 12.5% bigger and has a nicer animation.

  + The manual has extra white space at the bottom to make it easier to read.

  + The manual now has an edge to fall off of so the joke works. I'm very proud of it,
    pointless as it may be, and you CAN actually fall off, so be careful!

  + There is now a compat.js file, which I will use to fix things that don't work in
    certain browsers. For example, did you know that Internet Explorer actually doesn't
    support the includes(search, searchIndex) method on objects that have it? (Please
    note that this does not mean I have tested on IE, but if it works on IE that's great.)

  + You can now select text on headings in all browsers, but you still can't see it.

  * All emoji that show them have more defined teeth!

  * Decreased the file size of some emoji by resaving them without any extra data.

  * Decreased the post ID size to two characters instead of five, because there really
    won't ever be 9,216 posts at any given time.

  * emoji now have-dashes-for-spacing where they would previously havenospacing.

  * Ended up switching to ASCII after all! That might change, though.

  * Modified the manual background.

  * Posts are now stored in a binary format, so all prior posts are broken. Luckily
    nobody uses this software or whatever it is yet!

  * Post titles can now be up to 60 characters, 10 more than the previous 50.

  * Post titles must now be at least 12 characters, 4 more than the previous 9.

  * Renamed the :faceless: emoji to :head:.

  * Renamed the :minecraft/useless: emoji to :minecraft/diamond-hoe:.

  * Renamed the :tongue-wink: emoji to :silly-wink:.

  * The :beaming: emoji is no longer creepy!

  * The :blowing-a-kiss: emoji no longer looks like it got punched in the face.

  * The :grinning: emoji now faces the viewer!

  * The :happy: emoji is now even happier!

  * The :silly: emoji no longer looks like it scrambled eggs for eyes!

  * The :smiling: emoji now has a smaller smile to be less creepy!

  * The :upside-down: face emoji now has correct shading.

  * The :wide-eyed-grin: emoji is no longer creepy and faces the other way.

  * The :wink: emoji now smiles wider on one side.

  i All text selection is red inside block quotes like it was supposed to be.

  i Calling postbox.admin.amIIn() now actually works instead of throwing an error.

  i Fixed the "Postbox" heading at the top and made it less distracting.

  i Fixed the Minecraft emoji that had underscores in their names.

  i Somewhere along the line, the tears of joy emoji got replaced with the faceless emoji.

  i The emoji section of the manual is now up-to-date.

  i The manual and changelog now use emoji as the plural for emoji. Emoji is technically
    more correct, since it is correct in multiple languages.

  i The :minecraft/bed: emoji is no longer 14.9 kibibytes in size. I swear I copied it
    directly from the resource pack on [ https://minecraft.net/addons ]!

  ~ The localStorage variable is now declared as a constant.

  ~ The main selection style is now in the main stylesheet instead of the content one.

  ~ The translation strings "error.readPost.*" are now "error.read.*".

  ~ Where'd all my semicolons go?

  ! Certain emoji have a weird black spot in the top left corner for an unknown reason. I
    probably just accidentally clicked up there with the spraypaint tool, will fix later.

--  Alpha  0.10.1  --

  @ I need someone to do some testing in browsers other than just
    Safari and Chrome.

  @ Most -.-.x will contain emoji, and as such they do not warrant another -.x.

  @ The character encoding will not be switched to ASCII. Don't fix what ain't broken.

  + Added the halo, love, heart eyes, star-struck, kissy face, blowing a kiss, slow kiss,
    happy kiss, mmm, tongue out, tongue wink, silly, mean face, and money mouth emoji.

  * The :happy: emoji is now more friendly looking.

  * The help button has slightly rounded corners now.

  * The patch notes from version 0.10 now refer to the next *major* update.

  * The post list is now more rounded and has padding like before.

  i Emoji are non-draggable again! Not sure how that happened.

  i Emoji are now aligned properly to the bottom of the text.

  i The patch note for fixing the header on the patch notes for 0.9.2 now
    correctly says 0.9.2, and not 0.9.3.

  i The post list isn't covered up by the GUI at the bottom anymore.

  ! I am fully aware that Postbox needs a smarter sorting algorithm. I'll work on it.

--   Alpha  0.10   --

  @ I'm going to try to make more substantial releases from now on
    instead of quick series of many tiny releases.

  + Postbox has a new, higher contrast look, and I made the CSS more D.R.Y!

  * Fixed the header on the Alpha 0.9.2 patch notes.

  i Blockquotes are actually rendered now!

  i The vote buttons now visually press properly!

--   Alpha 0.9.2   --

  @ Is it weird that for some reason whenever I draw a smiley I start
    to actually do whatever facial expression I'm drawing?

  + Added a few, not nearly all, of the smiley emoji.

  + The patch notes from Alpha 0.9 include the part about version prefixes.

--   Alpha 0.9.1   --

  @ I haven't added normal people emoji yet, but I'll get on it when
    GIMP stops causing me to lose brain cells.

  + Added a brand new Minecraft emoji set!

  * emoji have been reverted back to PNGs because I'm lazy, and they
    have to actually be PNGs, not just use the .png extension.

  * The Alpha 0.1 patch notes are now formatted correctly and accurately
    describe alpha 0.1.

--    Alpha 0.9    --

  - Removed all emoji for now, so that I can try to draw them well.

  - Removed lots of unnecessary files that were supposed to be removed!

  + The changelog now includes Alpha 0.1 just for the sake of completeness.

  * The alpha version prefix is now "a" instead of "v".

  * The changelog now goes from the most recent version at the top to the
    oldest documented version at the bottom.

  i Patched a HUGE security hole. So apparently function declarations aren't
    block scoped and are actually function scoped... Good to know.

--    Alpha 0.8    --

  @ How do I make it stop copying my JS files into the root directory?

  + Add a few face emoji. Not all of them, just a few.

  + Added the Alpha 0.7 changelog because apparently it didn't upload last time.

  * emoji are now GIFs. Not only does this allow animated emoji, but it also
    reduces their file size and allows for easier pixel art coloring. I haven't
	converted all the existing emoji yet, but those will be available soon.

  i Emoji hovernotes now include the :colons:.

  i emoji are no longer draggable.

  i emoji are now 16x16 pixels so the Minecraft ones look nice.

  i emoji no longer have alt text, and will now only display the broken image icon.

  i The default emoji no longer ever have under_scores in their names, as
    _underscores_ are used in Markdown to italicize text.

  ! Don't ask why the emoji aren't transparent yet. It's MS Paint.

--    Alpha 0.7    --

  + I added Minecraft emoji because Fortnite bad.

  * Using an emoji will now show an image from the /emoji directory, like I said
    in Alpha 0.6.1. This is a big update, as it means I or anyone will be able to
    add and remove emoji at will, but it's also a big responsibility because I
    have to manually add all the emoji. (Oh no!) emoji can be placed anywhere
    within the emoji directory or any subdirectory and must be saved with the
    file extension .png, not necessarily PNG format but who cares?

--   Alpha 0.6.1   --

  + There is now a section in the markdown guide about emoji. It currently
    only includes emoji beginning the letter A and the B emoji, but will be
    expanded over time as I release more versions. At least 15 more emoji in
    the table per release until they're all included.

  ? Going to modify showdown.js so that it will display images from the /emoji
    folder instead of actual emoji, then it will look nice on all fonts. :smile:

--    Alpha 0.6    --

  - HTML tags can no longer be used in posts, although you can still use
    character entities. I do plan to switch to ASCII after all.

  + Added more to the Markdown guide.

  + You can now define image dimensions.

  + You can now use tables in your posts.

  * Changed the manual background to be less GPU intensive.

--    Alpha 0.5    --

  @ I am now going to strictly follow semantic versioning.

  + Postbox now has an event system, but it doesn't really do much yet.

  + The manual can now have tables in it.

  + The manual now contains a proper Markdown guide. It's very incomplete, but
    will be expanded upon in Alpha 0.5.1.

  + The manual now has its own selection style!

  * The default title character limit is now 60 characters instead of 50.

  i Fixed the <code> style in the manual.

  i Fixed the order of the bullet points in Alpha 0.3.1's changelog.

  ~ Removed the trailing blank line from some of the files.

  ? Planning to add a technical section to the manual.

  ? Planning to add events (programming events, not social events) to Postbox.

  ? Probably going to change the post title and content to use ASCII, since you
    can use GitHub emoji on Postbox now.

  ! I am aware that Markdown allows you to use any URL for a link including
    JavaScript execution and that this is a security issue.

--    Alpha 0.4    --

  @ If you enable admin mode and aren't authorized you're a furry and you indent
    your code with spaces instead of tabs.

  + Began adding admin functionality. Currently the only admin methods available
    are postbox.admin.hardReset() and postbox.admin.resetCooldowns(). If admin
    mode is disabled and you try to use these, an error will be thrown.

--   Alpha 0.3.2   --

  ~ Apparently the error message when your post content was outside the valid
    character range used the title character range.

--   Alpha 0.3.1   --

  @ Did you know there are configuration settings inside postbox.js?

  @ Sorry if this version's patch notes have the sections in the wrong order,
    I'm supposed to be sleeping.

  - Removed Herobrine.

  - Removed postbox-old.js. That was supposed to get deleted before release.

  - Removed showdown.min.js.map.webloc. Not sure what that was.

  - Removed the old duplicate changelog.txt from Postbox Web Interface.
    Not sure how it got there.

  + Postbox's Showdown configuration now has emoji enabled.

  + There are now announcements in the changelog.

  + The manual now links to Showdown's syntax guide.

  * "Internal change" is now called "logical change."

  ~ If an error occurs when loading a post, the post is just skipped instead
    of failing to display the other posts. This behavior also applies to all
    Postbox methods that use the postbox.read method for multiple posts, which
    is currently just postbox.removeExpiredPosts.

  i The localStorage is now reversed-sandboxed by default.

  ? Going to reintroduce admin-only methods.

--    Alpha 0.3    --

  + Downvotes actually exist now!

  + The manual now includes an incomplete section all about Markdown.

  + The translation engine now supports multiple variables.

  * It is now COMPLETELY impossible for posts to overwrite each other. In addition to
    this, post IDs now consist of 5 characters instead of 4.

  i Removed all the bad code. What did it cost? All of the code. Basically, I just
    rewrote postbox.js because it was a buggy mess.

  ~ Most numbers are now stored as base-36 because I'm terrible.

  ~ The translation engine is now a separate script that the Postbox engine depends on.

--   Alpha 0.2.1   --

  + Added this to the changelog.

  + Established that the names of update commits will use lowercase for the word update.

  + Fixed the post dates and by extension the auto-removal system! Yay!
    Turns out I was multiplying the character codes by multiples of 256
    instead of 65536, because UTF-16, you know... is literally UTF-*16*.

  + Wrote a bit more of the manual.

--    Alpha 0.2    --

  + Added this changelog! :)

  + Hovering the mouse over a post's title now shows its ID.

  + Introduced an upvote / downvote system, currently known as "points."
    Posts may be upvoted or downvoted every five minutes. Once a post is
    voted, five minutes must pass before another post can be voted. The
    cooldown might be changed in the future to prevent addictions to
    self-upvoting, but it's basically like Reddit but with cooldowns.
    Making it actually took much longer than I thought it would.

  + Introduced new styles for <code> elements, which are now also copied
    automatically just by triple-clicking them, because we all copy half
    our code from GitHub. The other 90% is from StackOverflow. When you
    hover over it, it fades in to a very l33t color scheme.

  + List items now glow white when hovered over and are now copied with
    a triple-click.

  + There's a manual now! Access it with the button in the top right.
    It's not even close to being ready though.

  + Tried to add the auto-deletion thing the manual mentions but it was
    saying some date in 1970 for absolutely no reason and it makes me so
    freaking mad!!!!!!!!!! That's why I disabled it and you won't see it
    in this release. Hopefully I can fix whatever this heckin' bug is.

  * Improved the block quote styles.

  * Posts are now sorted by their newness AND their score (since scores just got added).

  * Tweaked what cursors are used where.

--    Alpha 0.1    --

  @ I added the things.

  @ This release is only in here for historical purposes. There wasn't really an
    alpha 0.1; the first named version was actually alpha 0.2.

  + I added the things.

  ! It took me 13 days to notice my grammar errors...

--                 --
